  <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Amyloid is a term used to describe deposits of fibrillar proteins, typically extracellular. The abnormal accumulation of amyloid, amyloidosis, is a term associated with tissue damage caused by amyloid deposition, seen in numerous diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's. Amyloid deposits consist predominantly of amyloid fibrils, rigid, non-branching structures that form ordered assemblies, characteristically with a cross beta-sheet structure where the sheets run parallel to the direction of the fibril (Sawaya et al. 2007). Often the fibril has a left-handed twist (Nelson &amp; Eisenberg 2006). At least 27 human proteins form amyloid fibrils (Sipe et al. 2010). Many of these proteins have non-pathological functions; the trigger that leads to abnormal aggregations differs between proteins and is not well understood but in many cases the peptides are abnormal fragments or mutant forms arising from polymorphisms, suggesting that the initial event may be aggregation of misfolded or unfolded peptides. Early studies of Amyloid-beta assembly led to a widely accepted model that assembly was a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction (Teplow 1998) but it is now understood to be more complex, with multiple 'off-pathway' events leading to a variety of oligomeric structures in addition to fibrils (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), though it is unclear whether these intermediate steps are required in vivo. An increasing body of evidence suggests that these oligomeric forms are primarily responsible for the neurotoxic effects of Amyloid-beta (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), alpha-synuclein (Winner et al. 2011) and tau (Dance &amp; Strobel 2009, Meraz-Rios et al. 2010). Amyloid oligomers are believed to have a common structural motif that is independent of the protein involved and not present in fibrils (Kayed et al. 2003). Conformation dependent, aggregation specific antibodies suggest that there are 3 general classes of amyloid oligomer structures (Glabe 2009) including annular structures which may be responsible for the widely reported membrane permeabilization effect of amyloid oligomers. Toxicity of amyloid oligomers preceeds the appearance of plaques in mouse models (Ferretti et al. 2011). &lt;br&gt;Fibrils are often associated with other molecules, notably heparan sulfate proteoglycans and Serum Amyloid P-component, which are universally associated and seem to stabilize fibrils, possibly by protecting them from degradation.

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Amyloid fibril formation is associated with a wide range of diseases (Chiti &amp; Dobson 2006), though the accumulation and deposition of fibrillar material does not correlate well with disease pathogenesis and it is now widely believed that oligomeric amyloid forms are largely responsible for the cytotoxic effects of amyloid (Glabe 2009). Fibrils have been described as more like crystalline polymer structures than the protein monomers they are derived from (Wetzel et al. 2007). In vitro, fibril formation is usually preceded by the association of monomers into oligomeric structures (Kodali &amp; Wetzel 2007), though this remains to be established in vivo. Amyloid-beta forms spherical structures with around 12 units (Bernstein et al. 2005). Larger structures called protofibrils are also observed, non-spherical filamentous structures lacking a periodic substructure (Goldsbury 2005). </Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">In addition to the main fibril peptide, mature amyloid fibrils have additional components. Serum amyloid P component (SAP) binds to all types of amyloid fibrils and is a universal constituent of amyloid deposits. SAP binding protects amyloid fibrils from proteolytic degradation (Tennent et al. 1995, Westermark 2005). SAP may function as a chaperone for amyloid formation (Coker et al. 2000).

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans are found associated with all types of amyloid deposits (Alexandrescu 2005). Of the different types of GAG heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate are the most prominent in amyloid deposits (Hirschfield &amp; Hawkins, 2003). GAGs have been implicated in the nucleation of fibrils, they can also stabilize mature fibrils against dissociation (Yamaguchi et al. 2003) and proteolytic degradation (Gupta-Bansal et al. 1995).

Perlecan coimmunolocalizes with all types of amyloids (Snow &amp; Wright 1989), accelerating fibril formation (Castillo et al. 1998), stabilizing them once formed (Castillo et al. 1997), and protecting them from proteolytic degradation (Gupta-Bansal et al. 1995).

ApoE tightly binds to soluble ABeta peptide forming complexes that resist dissociation; it also binds to ABeta in its fibril form (Bales et al. 2002).  </Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Serum amyloid P component (SAP) binds DNA and chromatin in a calcium dependent manner in physiological conditions (Pepys et al. 1987). This binding displaces H1-type histones (Butler et al. 1990), solubilizing chromatin which is otherwise insoluble in extracellular fluids. SAP may therefore participate in the in vivo handling of chromatin exposed by cell death. SAP knockout mice spontaneously develop antinuclear autoimmunity and severe glomerulonephritis, a phenotype resembling human systemic lupus erythematosus, a serious autoimmune disease, suggesting that SAP binding may play a role in reducing the immunogenicity of chromatin and preventing autoimmunity (Bickerstaff et al. 1999). </Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Seven in absentia homolog 1 (SIAH1) and 2 (SIAH2) are E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases that mediate ubiquitination of a number of target proteins including Synphilin-1 (SNCAIP) (Nagano et al. 2003) and alpha-synuclein (Liani et al. 2004). They are inhibited by the 1A isoform of SNCAIP (Szargel et al. 2009). When ubiquitinated by SIAH1, SNCAIP is targetted for proteasomal degradation (Nagano et al. 2003). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Synphilin-1 (SNCAIP) is a presynaptic protein that associates with synaptic vesicles (Ribeiro et al. 2002). It is present in many types of cytoplasmic inclusions, where it colocalizes with alpha-synuclein. It is associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD) because it is an intrinsic component of Lewy bodies (Wakabayashi et al. 2000) and a mutation of the SNCAIP gene has been identified in some PD patients (Marx et al. 2003), suggesting that accumulation of synphilin-1 and its interaction with alpha-synuclein may be relevant for Lewy body formation in PD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Synphilin-1 (SNCAIP) is ubiquitinated by several other E3 ubiquitin-ligases, including Parkin (Chung et al. 2001) and Dorfin (Ito et al. 2003).</Comment>

PARK2 overexpression with SNCAIP in cell culture leads to the formation of protein aggregates (Chung et al. 2001). PARK2 preferentially mediates the addition of lysine-63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination of SNCAIP (Lim et al. 2005). This leads to SNCAIP degradation only at an unusually high PARK2 to SNCAIP ratio (Lim et al. 2005). K63-linked ubiquitination may be a signal that leads to the degradation of inclusions by autophagy when the ubiquitin-proteasome system is dysfunctional (Lin et al. 2005, Tan et al. 2008).</Comment>

Ubiquitination of SNCA by SIAH1 is disrupted by the Parkinson's Disease (PD)-linked A30P mutation but not by the A53T mutation. SIAH1 binds the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2L6 (UBCH8) (Lee et al. 2008). This facilitates the mono- and di-ubiquitination of SNCA in vivo, but does not target SNCA for proteasomal degradation, rather it promotes SNCA aggregation and enhances toxicity (Lee et al. 2008). Monoubiquitinated SNCA may work as a seed for aggregation (Engelender 2008) and recruit other PD-related proteins, such as SNCAIP and UCHL1.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">SIAH1 transfers ubiquitin from UBE2L6 to SNCA, generating monoubiquitinated SNCA (Ub-SNCA) (Liani et al 2004, Rott et al. 2008, Lee et al. 2008). Monoubiquitination of SNCA promotes its aggregation in vitro and in vivo, which is toxic to cells. Lewy Bodies, a characteristic of Parkinson's Disease, contain monoubiquitinted SNCA deposits (Hasegawa et al. 2002). Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrates that SIAH monoubiquitinates alpha-synuclein at lysines 12, 21, and 23 (Rott et al. 2008).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monoubiquitination is generally thought to lead to degradation via the lysosomal pathway (d'Azzo et al. 2005) but monoubiquitinated SNCA appears to be preferentially targeted for degradation by the proteasome (Rott et al. 2011).</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">SNCA is monoubiquitinated and under some circumstances released to accumulate in the cell. Alternatively Ub-SNCA may undergo further rounds of ubiquitination producing diubiquitinated or polyubiquitinated forms. The precise mechanism of release and subsequent further ubiquitination is unclear (Sadowski et al. 2011); the E3 ligase may remain bound to SNCA while the E2 ligase dissociates to be replaced by a Ubiquitin-associated replacement, or the E2/E3 complex may dissociate completely allowing a different E3 to bind the SNCA substrate.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Seven in absentia homolog (SIAH1) and 2 (SIAH2) are E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases that mediate ubiquitination of a number of target proteins including Synphilin-1 (SNCAIP) (Nagano et al. 2003, Liani et al. 2004). When ubiquitinated by SIAH1, SNCAIP is targetted for proteasomal degradation (Nagano et al. 2003). SIAH1 and SIAH2 are inhibited by the 1A isoform of SNCAIP (Szargel et al. 2009). SIAH1 can bind the brain-enriched E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2L6 (Lee et al. 2008) but the E2 involved in SNCAIP ubiquitination has not been established.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Synphilin-1 (SNCAIP) is a presynaptic protein that associates with synaptic vesicles (Ribeiro et al. 2002). It is present in many types of cytoplasmic inclusions, where it colocalizes with alpha-synuclein. It is associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD) because it is an intrinsic component of Lewy bodies (Wakabayashi et al. 2000) and a mutation of the SNCAIP gene has been identified in some PD patients (Marx et al. 2003), suggesting that accumulation of synphilin-1 and its interaction with alpha-synuclein may be relevant for Lewy body formation in PD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Synphilin-1 (SNCAIP) is ubiquitinated by several other E3 ubiquitin-ligases, including Parkin (Chung et al. 2001) and Dorfin (Ito et al. 2003).</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">SNCAIP is ubiquitinated by several different E3 ubiquitin-ligases, including Parkin (PARK2). PARK2 overexpression with SNCAIP in cell culture leads to the formation of protein aggregates (Chung et al. 2001). PARK2 preferentially mediates the addition of lysine-63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination of SNCAIP (Lim et al. 2005). This leads to SNCAIP degradation only at an unusually high PARK2 to SNCAIP ratio (Lim et al. 2005). K63-linked ubiquitination may be a signal that leads to the degradation of inclusions by autophagy when the ubiquitin-proteasome system is dysfunctional (Lim et al. 2005, Tan et al. 2008).</Comment>

Specifically, nascent BACE1 is transiently acetylated on seven lysine residues in the ER lumen which protects the nascent protein from degradation in the ER Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and allows it to reach the Golgi apparatus (Ko &amp; Puglielli 2009, Costantini et al. 2007). Lysine-acetylated BACE1 (7K-BACE1) is deacetylated in the Golgi apparatus. </Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Amyloid precursor protein (APP(18-770)) is processed by one of two distinct proteolytic pathways; the non-amyloidogenic pathway where alpha-secretase cleaves APP at the cell surface within the A-beta domain, liberating APPs-alpha and the amyloidogenic pathway, where beta-secretase followed by gamma-secretase cleavages results in peptides which are the main fibril-forming peptides implicated in Alzheimer's disease. In the first step of the amyloidogenic pathway, the endosomal membrane protein beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) catalyses the cleavage of APP(18-770) within the ectodomain and liberates a soluble proteolytic fragment, termed soluble APP-beta (APPs-beta, APP(18-671)) and C99 (APP(672-770) (Baranello et al. 2015, Andrew et al. 2016). APP processing can occur in several endocytic and secretory pathways. For simplicity, the endosome has been chosen in this event.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Calbindin (CALB1, aka D-28K, CAB27) is a calcium binding protein with six EF hand domains, functions as both a calcium buffer and a sensor protein and plays a vital role in neurological function. CALB1 binds four calcium ions at its four functional calcium-binding sites (EF hands 1,3,4 and 5), subsequently undergoing a conformational change. EF hands 2 and 6 are known not to bind calcium (Kojetin et al. 2006, Hobbs et al. 2009). Cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain (BFCN) are selectively vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most of the BFCN in the human brain contain CALB1 and a large proportion lose their CALB1 in the course of normal aging. The BFCN which degenerate in AD lack CALB1, depriving neurons of the capacity to buffer high levels of intracellular calcium and thus leaving them vulnerable to pathological processes, such as those in AD, which can cause increased intracellular calcium, leading to their degeneration (Geula et al. 2003, Ahmadian et al. 2015).</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">The ADAM (A disintegrin and metalloprotease domain) family are membrane-anchored metalloproteases that mediate the proteolytic cleavage of many transmembrane proteins within their extracellular regions. This so-called ectodomain shedding plays an important role in many cell and developmental processes. ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10) has been identified as the major physiological alpha-secretase in neurons (Lammich et al. 1999, Kuhn et al. 2010), responsible for cleaving amyloid precursor protein (APP) in a non-amyloidogenic manner and producing APPs-alpha, a neuroprotective APP-derived peptide.&lt;p&gt;The trafficking of ADAM10 is regulated by a subgroup of the tetraspanin superfamily which have eight cysteines in the largest of the two extracellular domains and are referred to as TspanC8 tetraspanins. Tetraspanins associate specifically and directly with a limited number of proteins, and also with other tetraspanins, thereby generating a "tetraspanin web". Through these interactions, tetraspanins are believed to have a role in cell and membrane compartmentalisation (Charrin et al. 2014). TSPAN4, 14, 15 and 33 are thought to mediate ADAM10 exit from the ER and transport to the plasma membrane in a variety of ways (Noy et al. 2016, Jouannet et al. 2016).</Comment>

This cleavage also produces a cellular fragment, C83/CTF-alpha (APP(688-770). Cleavage by alpha-secretase at the cell surface is the major pathway in APP processing, accounting for 80â€“90% of APP turnover.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Beta secretase 1 (BACE1) catalyses the cleavage of APP(18 770) within the ectodomain and liberates a soluble proteolytic fragment, termed soluble APP beta (APPs beta, APP(18 671)) (Parvathy  et al. 1999, Kinoshita et al. 2003). APPs beta is subsequently cleaved by the presenilin (PS) containing gamma secretase complex to eventually (step wise details of multiple cleavages not shown here) liberate the neurotoxic Abeta peptides 42 and 40 (APP(672 713) and APP(672 711) respectively) (Huse et al. 2002, Ehehalt et al. 2003, Anderson et al. 2005, Fukumori  et al. 2006, Takami et al. 2009, Andrew et al. 2016).</Comment>
